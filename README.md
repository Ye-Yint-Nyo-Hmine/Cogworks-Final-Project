## Introduction
For our Final Capstone Project for BWSI, we created a collection of security features that are accessible through a LLM user interface. 
Our model makes use of pretrained models as well as curated datasets for our varied features. 
<br/>
*Note: This project was created as part of BWSI CogWorks Week 4 Final Capstone project.*
*Presented by Team We Love Bytes 2024.*

## Features
These are some important features that our program can accomplish:
- [x] A fully developed user interface with a pretrained Llama 3 model with the ability to answer questions
- [x] Speech to text and text to speech in the user interface
- [x] Object detection in video files and through live camera
- [x] Facial recognition and motion detection through live camera
- [x] Crying baby detection through audio
- [x] Fire detection through image
