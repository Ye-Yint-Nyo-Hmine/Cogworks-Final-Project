# ByteGSPT - architecture of Ollama's Llama3 model

## What is it?
> ByteGSPT stands for Byte - Generative Security Pre-trained Transformer

## How does it help the security system?
> With high capabilities of live monitoring and analysis of the whole system,
> ByteGSPT provides a connection and interface to the user
> It can also make decisions to initiate certain tasks accordingly without user input,
> leading to a more advance and robust security system

## How good is it?
